Notification worker service - Microservice
===========================
Responsible to listen new notifications sent by the [Notification ETL service microservice](https://github.com/IsmaelTerreno/notification-etl-service) through RabbitMQ and send them to the Decaf API notification service. This implementation is based on the coding task mentioned down below.

## Coding Task: Create a Stellar Notification System for Decaf Wallet

Objective: Develop a microservice-based notification system that monitors Stellar transactions and notifies Decaf users
of relevant activities.

### Context:

Right now in the Decaf wallet, when you receive a Solana transaction you will be notified. But on stellar we are yet to
have this, due to the unavailability of third party indexing and webhook services. We need your help!

Create a system to notify our users on Stellar. If you have any suggestions outside of the guidelines they are more than
welcome. Your code will actually be implemented if we love it!

## Requirements:

- Parse the Stellar transactions
  stream → https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/list-all-transactions
- Identify Decaf users utilizing the Decaf Users API
- Notify the notification service when a Decaf user is found
- Implement the solution in a Microservice architecture
- Use TypeScript for implementation (if not using TypeScript, provide detailed comments and documentation)
- Note: All internal Decaf services endpoints should be mocked! i.e. Users Api and Notification endpoint

## Technical Specifications:

1. Create a microservice to
   handle [Stellar transaction stream parsing](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/data/horizon/api-reference/list-all-transactions)
2. Implement a service to interact with the Decaf Users API
    1. Example response from the users search api:

              }
            }
          }
        ]
        ```

3. Develop a notification service to process and send notifications to our “notifications service”
    1. Structure of notification service request

    ```json
    # Send Notifications API
    
    ## Endpoint
    POST /notifications/send
    
    ## Headers
    - `Content-Type: application/json`
    - `Authorization: <NOTIFICATIONS_API_KEY>`
    
    ## Request Body
    ```json
    {
      "userIds": ["user1", "user2", "user3"],
      "notification": {
        "title": "New Message",
        "body": "You have a new message!",
        "data": {
          "messageId": "12345",
          "sender": "John Doe"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

   ### Fields
    - `userIds` (required): An array of user IDs to send the notification to.
    - `notification` (required):
        - `title` (required): The title of the notification.
        - `body` (optional): The body text of the notification.
        - `data` (optional): Any additional JSON data to be sent with the notification.

   ## Notes
    - The `NOTIFICATIONS_API_KEY` must be included in the Authorization header for the request to be authenticated.
    - The `fcmToken` and `userId` are not included in the request body as they are handled internally by the server.
    - The server will retrieve the necessary FCM tokens for each user ID provided.

   ## Example cURL Request
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://staging.decafapi.com/notifications/send \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: your-notifications-api-key" \
      -d '{
        "userIds": ["user1", "user2"],
        "notification": {
          "title": "New Feature",
          "body": "Check out our latest update!",
          "data": {
            "featureId": "789",
            "version": "2.0"
          }
        }
      }'
    ```

4. Ensure proper error handling and logging throughout the system
5. (Bonus) Implement tests for each component
